# [Project 1: English Premier League (EPL) players stats season 2021-2022](https://github.com/AhmedSayed97/AhmedSayed97/blob/main/EPL_players_stats.xlsx)

I worked on this project to show my data analysis skills using MS Excel.
* I got the data from kaggle's datasets.
* Started working on this project by copying the dataset, and inserting it in a worksheet (all_players_stats cleaned).
* Inserted the data into a table.
* Checked if there are duplicate values (no duplicate values were found).
* Checked if there are missing values (Blanks) (no missing values were found).
* Cleaned the data in Player column by removing unwanted characters and inserting the players names correctly by using Find & Replace.
* Inserted the data into a pivot table, then added pivotcharts to make some visualizations.
* Inserted pivotcharts into a dashboard.
