# [Project 1: English Premier League (EPL) Players stats](https://github.com/AhmedSayed97/Ahmed-s-Portfolio/blob/main/EPL_players_stats.xlsx)

I worked on this project to show my skills in data analysis using MS Excel.

* I got the data from kaggle's datasets.
* Started the project by cleaning the data (checked if there are any duplicate values or missing values) no duplicates or missing values were found.
* Cleaned the data in the player column by removing unwanted characters and inserting the players names correctly using **Find&Replace**.
* Inserted the data into pivot tables, then inserted **pivotcharts** to visualize the data.
* Inserted **pivotcharts** into a Dashboard.
